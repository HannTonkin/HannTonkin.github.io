      An autonomous quadrotor system equipped with a winch-tethered magnet
      that is capable of perching on and sliding along a vertical surface for inspection at close
      proximity. The first realization of a tethered quadrotor that can hover and perch vertically
      near infrastructure elements, enabling a variety of surface manipulation and repair tasks.

  description: |
       An autonomous quadrotor system equipped with a passively adaptive perching mechanism which allows an aerial vehicle to stably attach to a variety of surfaces including tree branches and pipelines. A hybrid force-motion controller is developed to ensure the cable tension to be regulated as the vehicle achieves the desired attitude. The hybrid control approach exploits the mechanical compliance of the system to ensure reliable, stable attachment to irregular natural structures, and the addition of a winch allows the robot to stably orient itself in any position or orientation relative to the branch.

  description: |
      SmQ platform is a new platform for aerial manipulation,
        which consists of a tool (or frame) with multiple quadrotors
        connected to that by spherical joints, acting as distributed rotating thrust generators.
        Lyapunov control design is performed while taking into account the spherical joint limits
        in a form of real-time constrained optimization.

    We propose a novel control framework
    to enable a quadrotor to operate a tool attached on it.
    We fully characterize the internal dynamics of the spatial quadrotor tool operation,
    which arises due to the quadrotor’s under-actuation, and elucidate a
    seemingly counter-intuitive necessary condition for the internal stability,
    that is, the tool-tip should be located above the quadrotor’s center-of-mass.
    We further manifest that this internal dynamics can exhibit finite-time escape
    and propose a stabilizing action to prevent that.

      abstract: |
        We propose a novel control framework to enable a quadrotor to
         operate a tool attached on it. We first show that
          any Cartesian control at the tool-tip can be generated
          if and only if the tool-tip is located strictly above
          or below the quadrotor’s center-of-mass. We then fully
           characterize the internal dynamics of the spatial quadrotor
            tool operation, which arises due to the quadrotor’s under-actuation
            , and elucidate a seemingly counter-intuitive necessary
            condition for the internal stability, that is,
        the tool-tip should be located above the quadrotor’s
        center-of-mass. We further manifest that this internal
        dynamics can exhibit finite-time escape and propose a
        stabilizing action to prevent that. The theory is then
        illustrated for the problems of rotating tool operation
        and hybrid force/position control with relevant simulation results.
