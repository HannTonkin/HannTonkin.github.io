This is my collection of useful resources for learning robotics online. I will try my best to organize the materials (from generic to specific, fundamental to state-of-the-art) and hopefully update them frequently. 


I will start with some online courses first (video lectures available).

**Fundamentals**

[MIT - Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm) by Gilbert Strang is a good starting class.
